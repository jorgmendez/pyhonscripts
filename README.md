# Learning Python Scripts

This repository is a collection of small Python scripts and projects that I've created while learning Python.

## Scripts

- [Email Sender](email_sender.py): This Python script uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send an email from one email account to another. The email's content, including the sender's name, recipient email, subject, and message, are defined in the script. It sends the email using the Gmail SMTP server and requires the login credentials for the email account from which the email is being sent. Once the email is sent, the script will print "All good" to the console. You can modify the email's content by changing the email object's attributes in the script.

- [Guess the number](guess_the_number_game.py): This Python script generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess it. The range is determined by two integer values passed as command-line arguments. The script validates the user's input to ensure that it is within the specified range and that it is a valid integer. If the user guesses correctly, the script terminates and prints a congratulatory message. If not, the script continues to prompt the user for a guess until a correct answer is given.

To use the script, run it from the command line and pass two integer values as arguments, like this: python guess_number.py 1 100 (this will generate a random number between 1 and 100). You can modify the range of the numbers by changing the values passed as arguments to the script.


- [Script 3](script3.py):
